# Categories & Channels

## welcome
### rules
The #rules channel explains all rules & guidelines to participate in The DIA's Discord server. They are the production rules. Whenever the [DIA Discord Rules & Guidelines](https://github.com/Dental-Integrators-Association/diadocs/blob/main/dia-discord/dia-discord-rules-guidelines.md) document is updated, this channel's pinned messages are updated with the latest rules & guidelines. This channel is also the only channel the role @everyone can see. This is also the channel the promoted invite link is linked too.

# Roles
## @everyone
The default role for the DIA's discord server. It cannot see any category or channel except #rules. @everyone must agree to the rules & guidelines before seeing and using the DIA's discord server.

## @follower
This is the default role users are assigned to once they agree, aka üëç to Carl-bot's message in #rules, to the rules & guidelines. They can see & use almost the enterity of the DIA's discord server except for private channels that are for paying members only or specifically have further rules & guidelines.

## @member
This is the role users are assigned after going through #member-verify. They are picked a vanity team, but the @member role designates privelaged status and permissions with the DIA's discord server. They will have access to member only areas and wil be given priority spearker privelage just like admins & mods.

## @team-<comapny-name>
This role is a vanity rule for users that verify as paying company members for the DIA.

## @mod
This is a role a user is assigned to moderate, or basically enforce, the rules & guidelines. They can also manage the entirity of the DIA's discord server, but their main responsiblity is keeping order by enforcing the rules & guidelines to the best of their judgment. Their secondary responbility is helping all end users of the DIA discord server.

## @admin
This is a role a user is assigned to administratate the DIA's discord server. Admins follow standard processes to ensure companies/teams are verified yearly as well as future processes. They are also responsible for driving change & new features. They will also be the main contributors & approvers to the DIA's discord server documentation.

## @dia-leadership
This role is for anyone in the DIA that holds a leadership position. Not all leaders in the DIA are responislbe for moderating, administrating, or developing DIA sub-communties directly. These are assigned by DIA Leadership and their commitees. We needed a role to recognize DIA Leadership & setting permissions for certain rooms without infering DIA Leadership is directly responsible for Discord or other communities.
