# Where do I start with Discord & specifically, The DIA's Discord?

## Step 1: Getting to know Discord
The DIA NextGen highly suggest anyone that hasn't used Discrod before, or only has herd of their off-spring using it to review the following guides below. One is a written guide, the other is a video. Enjoy!

- [How to use Discord (2022) Video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjiz6fyh-b-AhVNFFkFHdRNCeUQFnoECBgQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DOIqyPJQAgT4&usg=AOvVaw180l_QrEGjoK6IBIXXgEBs)
- [A Beginner's Guide To Discord](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjiz6fyh-b-AhVNFFkFHdRNCeUQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.discord.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord&usg=AOvVaw2Y_u9W0Kssr2aNB5zSB5mv)

## Step 2: Joining The DIA's Discord
You should now know what the invite link is. At least we hope. Next step is to click that invite link, in which the most current DIA Discord link looks like this https://discord.gg/btMnH7GqMa. 
Once you are in, you will pretty much see a blank slate like this.

Please scroll up, review all the rules. Then give a thumbs up to Carl-bots message. This means you agree to them!

After you agree, The DIA Discord server shall open up. Paying members need continue to Step 4.

## Step 4: Verifying DIA Membership
Currently, we have no official, very good automated way to verify employees of companies where the company is a paying DIA member. For now, travel to #member-verify channel. There you can react according the company you belong to. The companies listed here are audited yearly. If you belong to one, react with the emoji assigned to your company/team. It is the Company's/Team's responisbility to verify its own team members, not the DIA.
