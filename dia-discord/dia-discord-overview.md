# What is Discord?
The best way to learn what Discord is directly from the source. It is way too much information to plop in this Overview. Enjoy! [What is Discord? A Guide for Parents & Educators.](https://discord.com/safety/360044149331-what-is-discord)

# Objectives
The DIA has a problem of collaborating in an efficient manner on current projects. Scheduling meetings can be tough to prioritize for the DIA when we're all doing this at a volunteer level. Also getting our peers withing our organizations to collaborate with different organizations via Microsoft Teams or Slack is very challenging. Discord solves that problem at being the perfect solution for inter-organizational collaboration.

We picked Discord because it is free to use, easy to use, and perfect for inter-organizational collaboration. There is a reason why gaming communities, software developers, and the blockchain world use Discord for collaboration. It just works.
