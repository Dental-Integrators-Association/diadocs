# Welcome To NextGen
Hello DIA Members. This note is coming directly from the DIA NextGen, which was born 04/15/23. We are sorry for the late start to our group. Some of you may already know about the quiet launches of the DIA Discord & Reddit, so this NextGen introduction are those "official" launches!

## What is DIA NextGen?
DIA NextGen is a committee that belongs to [The DIA](https://dentalintegrators.org/) to drive the next generation of DIA members, growth, and standardizing business technology. Currently there are two notable projects being run by DIA NextGen, and we need all of the DIA's help to push them forward. These projects are The DIA Discord & The DIA Reddit Page. We're asking for everyone's participation!

## What is Discord?
Discord is a popular communication platform designed for creating online communities where users can chat, voice call, and share media with each other. It's commonly used by gamers, but it has expanded to include communities focused on a wide range of interests. If you have technicians under the age of 30, there is a good bet they are already using it to either communicate with other colleagues in your organization or other friends that are technicians.  Discord allows users to create or join servers, which are essentially private chat rooms that can be customized with various channels, roles, and permissions.  This is what the DIA has created.

## What is Reddit?
Reddit, on the other hand, is a social news aggregation and discussion website where users can submit content in the form of links, images, and text posts. Other users can then vote on these submissions, which determines their position on the site's front page and in various topic-based subreddits. Reddit has a wide range of communities, known as subreddits, that cover topics such as news, technology, gaming, music, movies, and more. Users can interact with each other through comments and private messages, and they can also create their own subreddits based on their interests.

## What is the goal for all of this?
The goal of creating a Discord or Reddit page for the DIA is to provide easy access to centralized platforms to connect and communicate with each other.  These platforms can help the DIA to build a strong community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about what we do.
On Discord, members-only can chat in real-time, voice call, and share media with each other. This can help foster a community and allow for easy collaboration and coordination between members.
On Reddit, the DIA created a subreddit where we can share news, updates, and other information with followers outside of the DIA membership. We can submit our own content related to the DIA’s mission, interests, and knowledge, which can lead to discussions and engagement within the community and ultimately a higher knowledge base of the DIA for new members and understanding of the organization by the dental community.


## Why do I need to be a part of it?
Why do I need to be part of it?

There are several reasons why you would want to be a part of the DIA NextGen
1)	Connect with like-minded individuals: It can be a great way to meet new people, make friends, and build a community around your common goals.  As discussed already, by joining the DIA Discord or Reddit pages, you can connect with other members in DIA that you wouldn’t necessarily meet otherwise. 

2)	Stay informed: The DIAs Discord or Reddit page can be a source of information about upcoming events, news, and other updates. It can also be a valuable resource to connect with other people who are doing the same thing you are and could be a means for shortening the learning curve on an issue.

3)	Share your ideas: The platforms can be a vehicle for sharing your own ideas and perspectives with others in the organization. This can be a great way to contribute to discussions and help shape the direction of the group and industry as a whole.

Overall, being a part the DIA’s Discord or Reddit page can help you feel more connected to the group and provide opportunities for engagement and participation.
